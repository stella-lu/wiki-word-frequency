# wiki-word-frequency
This is a quick summer project from May-June 2018. It's a python program that graphs the 20 most popular words in wikipedia articles as a pie chart using [pyplot](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html), Beautiful Soup, and Tkinter.

To run the program, download the repository and run `python3 main.py`.
